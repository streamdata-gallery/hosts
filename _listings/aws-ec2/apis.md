description: Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud is a web service that provides resizable
  compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing
  easier for developers. Amazon EC2s simple web service interface allows you to obtain
  and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control
  of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon&rsquo;s proven computing
  environment. Amazon EC2 reduces the time required to obtain and boot new server
  instances to minutes, allowing you to quickly scale capacity, both up and down,
  as your computing requirements change. Amazon EC2 changes the economics of computing
  by allowing you to pay only for capacity that you actually use. Amazon EC2 provides
  developers the tools to build failure resilient applications and isolate themselves
  from common failure scenarios.
